Commands needed for setting up a development environment, building wheels, 
and uploading to PyPI

# Development environment

## Create the development environment, only needed once
python3 -m venv dev

## Activate the development environment
source ./dev/bin/activate

## Install the module locally using the source in-place
python3 -m pip install --editable .

# Testing

python3 -m pip install pytest
pytest

The package must be installed to be tested because the 
C library must be compiled and this is done during packaging.

# Update release version
The single-source package version is specified in:
src/mseedlib/__version__.py

The versioning follows the semantic versioning definition.

# Building distribution packages

## Ensure required build modules are installed
python3 -m pip install build twine

## Build sdist and wheel
python3 -m build

## Test and upload to PyPI
python3 -m twine check --strict dist/*
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
