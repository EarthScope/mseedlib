# mseedlib - a Python package to read and write miniSEED formatted data

The mseedlib package allows for reading and writing of [miniSEED](https://docs.fdsn.org/projects/miniseed3)
formatted data, which is commonly used for seismological and other geophysical
time series data.

The module leverages the C-language [libmseed](https://earthscope.github.io/libmseed)
for most of the heavy data format and manipulation work.

## Installation

The [releases](https://pypi.org/project/mseedlib/) should be installed
directly from PyPI with, for example, `pip install mseedlib`.
The package does not depend on anything other than the Python standard library.

## Example usage

Working programs for a variety of use cases ca be found in the
[examples](https://github.com/EarthScope/mseedlib/tree/main/examples) directory of the repository.

Read a file and print details from each record:
```Python
from mseedlib import MS3RecordReader,TimeFormat

with MS3RecordReader('testdata-3channel-signal.mseed3') as msreader:
    for msr in msreader:
        # Print values directly
        print(f'   SourceID: {msr.sourceid}, record length {msr.reclen}')
        print(f' Start Time: {msr.starttime_str(timeformat=TimeFormat.ISOMONTHDAY_SPACE_Z)}')
        print(f'    Samples: {msr.samplecnt}')

        # Alternatively, use the library print function
        msr.print()
```

Read a file into a trace list and print the list:
```Python
from mseedlib import MSTraceList

mstl = MSTraceList('testdata-3channel-signal.mseed3')

# Print the trace list using the library print function
mstl.print(details=1, gaps=True)

# Alternatively, traverse the data structures and print each trace ID and segment
for traceid in mstl.traceids():
    print(traceid)

    for segment in traceid.segments():
        print('  ', segment)
```

Writing miniSEED requires specifying a "record handler" function that is
a callback to consume, and do whatever you want, with generated records.

Simple example of writing multiple channels of data:
```Python
import math
from mseedlib import MSTraceList, timestr2nstime

# Generate synthetic sinusoid data, starting at 0, 45, and 90 degrees
data0 = list(map(lambda x: int(math.sin(math.radians(0)) * 500), range(0, 500)))
data1 = list(map(lambda x: int(math.sin(math.radians(45)) * 500), range(45, 500 + 45)))
data2 = list(map(lambda x: int(math.sin(math.radians(90)) * 500), range(90, 500 + 90)))

mstl = MSTraceList()

sample_rate = 40.0
start_time = timestr2nstime("2024-01-01T15:13:55.123456789Z")
format_version = 2
record_length = 512

# Add synthetic data to the trace list
mstl.add_data(sourceid="FDSN:XX_TEST__B_S_0",
              data_samples=data0, sample_type='i',
              sample_rate=sample_rate, start_time=start_time)

mstl.add_data(sourceid="FDSN:XX_TEST__B_S_0",
              data_samples=data1, sample_type='i',
              sample_rate=sample_rate, start_time=start_time)

mstl.add_data(sourceid="FDSN:XX_TEST__B_S_0",
              data_samples=data2, sample_type='i',
              sample_rate=sample_rate, start_time=start_time)

# Record handler called for each generated record
def record_handler(record, handler_data):
    handler_data['fh'].write(record)

file_handle = open('output.mseed', 'wb')

# Generate miniSEED records
mstl.pack(record_handler,
          {'fh':file_handle},
          flush_data=True)
```

## Package design rationale

The package functionality and exposed API are designed to support the most
common use cases of reading and writing miniSEED data using `libmseed`.
Extensions of data handling beyond the functionality of the library are
out-of-scope for this package.  Furthermore, the naming of functions,
classes, arguments, etc. follows the naming used in the library in order
to reference their fundamentals at the C level if needed; even though this
leaves some names distinctly non-Pythonic.

In a nutshell, the goal of this package is to provide just enough of a Python
layer to `libmseed` to handle the most common cases of miniSEED data without
needing to know any of the C-level details.
